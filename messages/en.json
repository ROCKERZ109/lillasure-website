Same quality. Same community. More love. More adventure.",

Beata has lived and worked in Asia, Europe, and the USA, gathering experiences and flavors from all corners of the world. Along the way, she met Sid. Sid has been playing with dough even before he learned to walk. An engineer by craft and an artist at heart, Sid built cars at Volvo before deciding to pursue what he is truly passionate about. Wake and bake.",
